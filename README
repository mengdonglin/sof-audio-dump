This is a tool to dump audio registers in host memory space.

Use the command to build the tool:
$gcc -O2 -g -Wall -Werror sof_audio_dump.c -lpciaccess -o hdaudio_dump

Please run this as root.

Usage: ./hdaudio_dump [OPTIONS]...

-h, --help              help
-o, --output=FILE       set output file for binary dump

Known issue: sometimes the data from mmio is invalid as 0xff.
Workaround: Use aplay -l to check the sound devices at first and
     then run this tool.


This tool only supports Broxton/ApolloLake now, but it's easy to extend.
